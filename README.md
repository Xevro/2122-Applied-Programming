# C# Applied programming

This repository contains 2 projects that I made in my 3th year at Odisee.

- The first project is a mandelbrot fractal application that makes it possible to explore the mandelbrot fractal.

### Solution 1 - Mandelbrot fractal application

You can find the source code under 'Blok 1/Oplossing 1' and inside the 'installatie package' is a installable package available with a self signed certificate.
